iBeaconEmitter
================

This project turn your iOS device to an iBeacon emitter. 
If you don't know W*F is an iBeacon read it from Apple documentation:

> iBeacon is a new technology that extends Location Services in iOS. Your iOS device can alert apps when you approach or leave a location with an iBeacon. In addition to monitoring location, an app can estimate your proximity to an iBeacon (for example, a display or checkout counter in a retail store). Instead of using latitude and longitude to define the location, iBeacon uses a Bluetooth low energy signal, which iOS devices detect. To learn more about Bluetooth technology, see the official Bluetooth website.

Supported devices:

* iPhone 4s or later
* iPad (3rd generation) or later
* iPad mini or later
* iPod touch (5th generation) or later

This project let you personalize the UUID, the major and the minor values, as well as the power. It is based on [BeaconEmitter for mac project](https://github.com/lgaches/BeaconEmitter).
